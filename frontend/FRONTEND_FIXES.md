# Frontend Issues Fixed

## Critical Issues Resolved

### 1. Performance Issues (Critical)
- **Fixed infinite re-renders in App.tsx**: Moved polling logic from component render to useEffect
- **Improved file polling**: Added retry logic and better error handling in useFilePolling hook
- **Optimized component updates**: Prevented unnecessary re-renders in polling components

### 2. Security Vulnerabilities (High)
- **Fixed XSS vulnerabilities in ExportDialog**: Added HTML sanitization for user content
- **Fixed log injection in API service**: Sanitized logged data to prevent injection attacks
- **Secured file operations**: Added filename sanitization to prevent path traversal

### 3. Error Handling (High)
- **Enhanced main entry points**: Added error boundaries and fallback UI
- **Improved environment config**: Added safe environment variable parsing
- **Better file upload handling**: Added comprehensive error handling for drag & drop
- **Enhanced copy functionality**: Improved clipboard operations with fallbacks

### 4. UI/UX Improvements
- **Added glassmorphism CSS**: Fixed missing CSS utility used throughout components
- **Improved error messages**: More user-friendly error descriptions
- **Better loading states**: Enhanced visual feedback during operations

## Files Modified

1. **App.tsx** - Fixed critical polling performance issue
2. **ExportDialog.tsx** - Fixed XSS vulnerabilities and error handling
3. **services/api.ts** - Fixed log injection vulnerabilities
4. **config/env.ts** - Enhanced environment configuration safety
5. **main.tsx** & **src/main.tsx** - Added error boundaries
6. **UploadPage.tsx** - Improved file handling
7. **EditorPage.tsx** - Enhanced copy functionality
8. **hooks/useFilePolling.ts** - Added retry logic and better error handling
9. **styles/globals.css** - Added missing glassmorphism utility

## Testing Tools Added

1. **test-frontend.html** - Simple test page to verify frontend/backend connectivity
2. **start-frontend.bat** - Windows startup script with dependency checks

## How to Start the Frontend

### Option 1: Using the startup script
```bash
# Windows
start-frontend.bat

# Manual (all platforms)
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Option 2: Manual startup
```bash
cd frontend
npm install  # Install dependencies
npm run dev  # Start development server
```

## Verification Steps

1. Open `test-frontend.html` in a browser to test connectivity
2. Ensure backend is running on port 8000
3. Frontend should be accessible on http://localhost:5173
4. Test file upload functionality

## Remaining Considerations

- Monitor for any remaining performance issues during heavy usage
- Consider implementing proper authentication if needed
- Add comprehensive error logging for production deployment
- Consider adding unit tests for critical components

All critical issues have been resolved. The frontend should now work properly with the backend.
